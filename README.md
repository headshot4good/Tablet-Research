My Research on Tablets and Monitors for Drawing:
================================================

I was mostly interested in the tablets to have high specs, be cheap as possible and prefferably have a scroll wheel so that I can rotate the drawings when using them.
For the on the go options I prioritized the 13Inch variants to the 16inch ones so that they can be carried with smaller laptops.
If you have a 15.6 Inch Laptop then I'd go with the 16inch correspondent. But be carefull to check dimensions before purchase. And check the fact you have a large enough bag to hold both the Laptop and the Tablet without squishing them together.
In my case the 15.6 Lenovo Y50-70 [ average laptop dimensions ] has the following dimensions:

391.16 x 266.7 x 19.05 mm
15.4   x 10.5  x 0.75 inches

I included Adobe RGB for workspace stations because color accuracy is mandatory.

In my books the for a studio / workspace I'd check the following [ > 90% Adobe RGB, so colors will be accurate ]
	* XP-Pen Artist Display 16 Pro
	* Artisul D16

An Important note for Graphic Monitors is that you will have to see reviews about them and check Parallax and Jitter reviews.
All Graphic Monitors have Parallax and Jitter, but try to find the one that has the least.
Also most Graphic Monitors have a 15-25ms Response Rate. Check that so that you experience less LAGG while drawing.


REMEMBER FOR STUDIO GRAPHIC MONITORS:
-------------------------------------
* PARALLAX 
	[ mostly due to the fact the reading layer is not directly beneath the glass ]
* JITTER 
	[ diagonal lines are not straight, but rather wiggly, also may refer to straight lines instead of curved ones ]
* RESPONSE TIME
	[ 15-25ms, more than that is really laggy, the time it takes for the monitor to send input from pen to computer, and get the response from the graphic card so that it displays pixels ]
* RESPONSE RATE
	[ 233-266 rps, the number of recorded points in a second while the Stylus is moving ]
* COLOR ACCURACY 
	[ > 90% Adobe RGB for accurate colors, otherwise prints could turn bad ]

Also express keys may not be necessary if you have the USB port to carry Macro Keyboard and mouse for scrollwheel, though its more comfortable to have it all in one than carry a lot of accessories.
Pen Holder is a fancy accessory but some artists tend to break / loose pens so it may help you stay organized.
I reffer to Tilt as being a fancy feature because I've never used it. Some experienced artists can use it to speed up their work by using heavy wight stylized strokes. But for anything else I've never heard people say its a required feature.


HUION LOOSES a lot of customers because for their products you have to pay customs tax and shipping. This is mostly because they don't have warehouses around the world like other companies do.
